- Front-end: Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, this project demonstrates my ability to create engaging games without the use of external libraries or frameworks.
- Tools: Utilizing Git and GitHub, this project was developed using modern version control techniques to ensure easy tracking of changes.

## Conclusion

This Alien Shooter game was an exciting project that allowed me to explore and learn about class and object-oriented programming for the first time. Despite the tight timeframe of just 2 days, I was able to implement several engaging features, including a high score system, lives system, laser shooting, coins for players to collect, and new enemy types to keep the gameplay fresh.

One of the biggest challenges was building the game without the use of any frameworks or libraries, relying solely on vanilla JavaScript. However, this allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of core programming concepts and helped me improve my skills as a developer. Overall, I am proud of what I was able to accomplish in just 2 days and I look forward to applying the knowledge gained from this project to future endeavors.
